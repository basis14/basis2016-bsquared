This portfolio management website allows for cohort to upload and display information to future employers or peers regarding themselves and any work they would like to display. The design was built for a LAMP stack, and is a database driven design that allows each member access into the website.\r\n\r\n###Requirements:\r\n1. XAMPP/WAMP SERVER\r\n2. PHP\r\n3. MySQL\r\n\r\n##Configuration:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the bsquared repository on you local server, typically xampp/htdocs/[bsquared]\r\n2. Import the schema.sql database from the data/sql directory to the MySQL service.\r\n3. The administrative password is T3chnology!! and the e-mail is set to youradmin@example.com.\r\n4. Ensure the user's are made in the MySQL Service. The website is set for an config.ini file to be placed outside the root in a folder that will store your passwords.\r\n    three users accounts were made for use on the database, one for visitors, one for members and one for administrators. You can view the separation of control in the includes that connect to the database.\r\n5. Browse to the localhost where your bsquared portfolio is running.\r\n6. phpmyadmin was used in the creation of the database and maybe used to ensure a successful configuration, not recommended for production use.\r\n7. The bsquared cohort default user authentication scheme is set but will be removed for public release. Once you are logged into the website under the admin, go to the add user under administrative, you may add as many users to get started.\r\n8. If there are any questions regarding the configuration of this portfolio website contact Aaron Young, mustarddevelopment@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###The MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2016-Present b[Squared]\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
